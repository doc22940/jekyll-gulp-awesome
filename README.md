# Jekyll and Gulp awesomeness

This is just a fresh [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) install + a whole lot of automation by [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).

Normalizer and [skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) css is in there, but if you more a bootstrappy person, feel free te delete it.



do this if you feel like coding:

	$ git clone https://github.com/wilbo/jekyll-gulp-awesome-raw.git
	$ cd jekyll-gulp-awesome-raw
	$ npm install
	$ gulp --dev
	
there are two main gulp tasks:
- 'gulp --dev' for developing.
- 'gulp deploy' for deploying. (Be sure to make a repo for that)
