# Jekyll and Gulp awesomeness

This is just a fresh Jekyll install + a whole lot of automation by Gulp.

Normalizer and [skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) css is used, no more.

there are two main gulp tasks:
- 'gulp --dev' for developing.
- 'gulp deploy' for deploying. (Be sure to make a repo for that)

if you want to code:

	$ git clone https://github.com/wilbo/jekyll-gulp-awesome-raw.git
	$ cd jekyll-gulp-awesome-raw
	$ npm install
	$ gulp --dev
